<h1 align="center">Geography with Rest Countries API<h1>

## Description:

This project is to practice my skills on integration with APIs. Also I could practice JavaScript, ReactJS and SCSS skills.

## Principal functions:

- List of all countries: I extracted from Rest Countries all the countries with some of their information and mounted a card for each one of them.
- Search countries: on header component there is a search button from which you can insert a string to find countries.
- Countries filter: I increased a filter component (an offcanvas) to search countries from its continent, geographical size or population size.

## Used technologies:

- HTML;
- SCSS;
- JavaScript;
- ReactJS;
- Vite.
